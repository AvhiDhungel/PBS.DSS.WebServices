**We want the AWR page to calculate total dynamically when customer clicks approve or decline. We can adjust the Estimated Labour and Parts easily, but what about taxes and fees?**
**For those to be accurate, we'd need to send out another connecthub call each time so that v10 can calculate them and pass back**
**Might still want to show an Estimate copy for details?**
